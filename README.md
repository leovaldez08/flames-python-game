FLAMES Game
This is a Python implementation of the classic FLAMES game, a popular party game played in many cultures around the world. 
The FLAMES acronym stands for Friends, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, and Siblings, which are the six possible outcomes of the game.

Rules of the Game
The rules of the game are simple. Two players enter their names, and all the common letters in their names are removed. 
The remaining letters are used to determine the outcome of the game using the FLAMES formula:

F: Friends
L: Love
A: Affection
M: Marriage
E: Enemy
S: Siblings

The game continues until only one outcome is left. The last remaining letter of the FLAMES formula is the result of the game.

How to Play:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the code file in VS Code or in your terminal.
3. The player or the first person should enter his/ her name when prompted.
4. Then he/she enters their crush’s/ friend’s/ partner’s name to check the compatibility match.
5. As soon as they enter both of the names, the result will be displayed.

The result will be calculated in the traditional way i.e, by counting the sum of unique letters in both of the entered names 
and striking one by one till they get the result.
