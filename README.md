FLAMES is a popular game played to find out the relationship status between two people. 
The acronym FLAMES stands for Friends, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, and Siblings. 

Here are the steps to play the game:
1. The player or the first person enter his/ her name
2. Then he/she enters their crush’s/ friend’s/ partner’s name to check the compatibility match.
3. As soon as they enter both of the names the flames function will show the appropriate output.

The result will be calculated in the traditional way i.e, by counting the sum of unique letters in both of the entered names 
and striking one by one till they get the result.
